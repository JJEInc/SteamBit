// Just a file for us to use to keep track of our thoughts, write down
// big picture ideas for Items, write pseudo-code for what we want
// classes and functions to do, etc.

Item.cs:
    Item attributes: name, value, weight
    Clothing attributes: color (should we do this using hex values?)
      // Not sure what else I can add to Clothing, any thoughts?
